                <li>You cannot refer the tutor to others for private booking</li>
                <li>You cannot create arrangements to work around this restriction</li>
                <li>This applies to all tutors you've worked with through the platform</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Liquidated Damages (Financial Penalty)</h4>
              <p>
                If you violate the platform use or non-solicitation requirements, you agree to pay Growth 
                Tutoring LLC:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  $2,000 USD OR 20 times the tutor's hourly rate per off-platform session, whichever is 
                  greater.
                </strong>
              </p>

              <h4>Purpose of the Fee</h4>
              <p>This is not a penalty – it is a reasonable estimate of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Lost platform revenue from bypassed bookings</li>
                <li>Safety and compliance costs (background checks, monitoring, support)</li>
                <li>Administrative costs of investigating violations</li>
                <li>Harm to platform ecosystem and other users</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>How We Calculate Damages</h4>
              <p>Examples:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tutor charges $40/hour → Damages = $2,000 (greater than 20 × $40 = $800)</li>
                <li>Tutor charges $150/hour → Damages = $3,000 (20 × $150)</li>
                <li>Multiple off-platform sessions → Damages multiply per session</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Enforcement</h4>
              <p>If you violate this policy, Company may:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Immediately suspend or terminate your account</li>
                <li>Revoke all refund protections and dispute resolution rights</li>
                <li>Withhold any pending refunds or credits</li>
                <li>Pursue legal action to recover liquidated damages</li>
                <li>Report violation to payment processors or authorities</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Tutor Reporting Requirement</h4>
              <p>
                Tutors are required to report client solicitation attempts to remain in good standing. If a tutor 
                reports that you requested off-platform services, Company will investigate and may take action.
              </p>

              <h4>Exceptions</h4>
              <p>This policy does NOT prohibit:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a professional relationship after the 12-month period expires</li>
                <li>Social connections (LinkedIn, etc.) after the 12-month period expires</li>
                <li>Referring the tutor to others who will book through the platform</li>
                <li>Continuing to book the tutor through the platform indefinitely</li>
